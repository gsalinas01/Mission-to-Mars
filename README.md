## Challenges
  * Understanding how Flask, Mongo, and my html file all work together to create the web app
  * Generating code that is easy to follow and understand. 
  * Overall, this was a fun and challenging project as I am still learning how to connect the different components of all the applications utilized. It is great to watch my code function and come together to create what was intended. Still, there's much to learn and practice!
